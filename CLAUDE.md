## Segment Classification — Mandatory Changelog Rule

Any change to segment detection, section merging, or section role classification
**must** be logged in `docs/segment-classification-changelog.md` before the change
is considered complete. This includes changes to:

- `src/story/section_classifier.py`
- `src/story/section_merger.py`
- `src/story/builder.py` (section extraction, label handling, or post-processing)
- Any orchestrator code that affects what boundaries are passed to the story builder

**Append only — never remove old entries.** The log exists to prevent going in circles
on classification logic. Read it before making any changes to understand what has
already been tried and why.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints on all public functions and class attributes
- Each algorithm class inherits from `base.Algorithm` and implements `run(audio_array, sample_rate) -> TimingTrack`
- Timestamps are always stored as integers (milliseconds) — never floats

## Recent Changes
- 023-devcontainer-path-resolution: Added Python 3.11+ + pathlib (stdlib), os (stdlib), hashlib (stdlib) — no new dependencies
- 023-devcontainer-path-resolution: Added Python 3.11+ + pathlib (stdlib), os (stdlib), hashlib (stdlib) — no new dependencies
- 021-song-story-tool: Added Python 3.11+ + librosa 0.10+, vamp, madmom 0.16+, demucs (htdemucs_6s), Flask 3+, click 8+, numpy
  `htdemucs_6s` separates audio into 6 stems (drums, bass, vocals, guitar, piano, other).
  Algorithms route to their preferred stem via `Algorithm.preferred_stem` class attribute.
  Stems are MD5-cached in `.stems/<hash>/` adjacent to the source file. Each `TimingTrack`
  carries a `stem_source` field. The `summary` command shows a `Stem` column. The review UI
  shows a stem badge on each track lane. New module: `src/analyzer/stems.py`.

  madmom produce 22 named timing tracks from a single MP3. Quality-scored JSON output
  with `--top N` auto-selection and manual track selection/export via CLI.
  serves a single-page Canvas+Web Audio app for visualizing timing tracks, synchronized
  playback, Next/Prev/Solo focus navigation, and filtered JSON export.
  with no args shows an upload page; SSE streams per-algorithm progress; browser auto-navigates
  to timeline when done. Vamp/madmom toggles on upload page.

## Future Work / TODOs

### Intelligent Effect Rotation (Tier 6-7)
- Current implementation cycles through `_PROP_EFFECT_POOL` in round-robin order per group.
- Future improvement: weight effect selection by section energy, mood, and tempo. High-energy
  sections should favor Meteors/Shockwave/Strobe; low-energy sections should favor
  Ripple/Spirals/Wave. The rotation seed should incorporate variation_seed so repeated
  sections get different effect assignments.
- Consider per-prop-type affinity: arches look best with Chase/Wave, mini-trees with
  Spirals/Fire, candy canes with Single Strand/Bars.

### QM Segmenter Boundary Merging
- The `_merge_qm_boundaries` function uses a simple 2-second minimum gap to avoid
  micro-sections. A better approach would weight QM boundaries by the energy change
  across the boundary (from L5 energy curves) and only merge boundaries with significant
  energy transitions.

### Value Curves Integration
- Value curves (`generate_value_curves` in `src/generator/value_curves.py`) are currently
  disabled (Phase 1 comment in `build_plan`). These allow effect parameters to change
  over time within a single effect placement — e.g. speed ramps up toward a beat drop,
  brightness follows the energy curve, color mix shifts with chord changes.
- Priority parameters for value curves:
  - **Brightness**: follow L5 energy curve so effects breathe with the music
  - **Speed**: ramp up during builds, slow down during drops
  - **Color mix**: shift palette position to follow chord changes (L6 harmony)
  - **Effect-specific**: Fire height follows energy, Ripple movement follows beats
- xLights supports value curves via `VC_` prefixed parameters in the effect string.
  The `supports_value_curve` flag in `builtin_effects.json` marks which parameters
  can accept curves. See `src/generator/value_curves.py` for the existing framework.

### Prop Effect Suitability and Selection
- Currently all prop groups get effects from the same pool (`_PROP_EFFECT_POOL`) without
  considering what looks good on each prop type. This needs a suitability matrix:
  - **Arches/Candy Canes** (linear): Single Strand, Bars, Wave, Marquee work well.
    Shockwave/Ripple render poorly on 1D props.
  - **Matrices** (2D grids): Plasma, Butterfly, Fire, Pinwheel look great.
    Single Strand wastes the 2D resolution.
  - **Mini props** (stars, ornaments, low pixel): On/Off, Strobe, Twinkle are most
    effective. Complex effects are wasted on <50 pixel props.
  - **Deer/figures** (custom shapes): Shimmer, Color Wash, Twinkle preserve the shape.
    Directional effects (Bars, Wave) ignore the form factor.
- Implementation: add a `suitability` dict to each effect in `builtin_effects.json`
  mapping prop display types (SingleLine, Custom, Matrix, Tree, etc.) to a 0-1 score.
  Use these scores in `_build_effect_pool` to weight selection per group based on the
  dominant prop type in that group.
- Also consider prop pixel count: high-density props can handle complex effects,
  low-density props should get simpler ones.

### End-of-Song Fade Out
- Songs that end with a gradual energy decrease (detected via L5 energy curves
  and _drop tagged sections) should have a smooth visual fade-out rather than
  an abrupt cut. Implementation options:
  - Apply a brightness value curve that ramps from 100% to 0% over the final
    _drop section on all active tiers
  - Progressively kill upper tiers one by one (heroes first, then compounds,
    then props, then beats) as energy decreases, leaving only the dim background
    wash for the final seconds
  - Use the existing fade_out_ms field on EffectPlacement to add crossfade
    on the last effect in each group
- This ties into the value curves integration above — a brightness ramp on
  the final section would be the simplest and most effective approach.

### 3D Effects, Blending, and Multi-Layer Effects
- Current implementation places one effect per layer per group. xLights supports
  stacking multiple effect layers on a single model/group with blend modes
  (Additive, Subtractive, Mask, etc.) to create composite visuals.
- **Layer stacking**: place the base effect on layer 1, then add an accent effect
  on layer 2 with a blend mode. E.g. Color Wash (layer 1) + Twinkle (layer 2,
  Additive) creates a twinkling wash. The theme already defines multi-layer
  setups — this would render them as actual stacked layers in the XSQ instead
  of mapping them to different tier groups.
- **3D model awareness**: props with WorldPosZ (depth) or 3D model types could
  use depth-based effects — front props brighter than back props, or effects
  that sweep in the Z direction. The layout parser already reads WorldPosZ.
- **Buffer transforms**: xLights supports per-layer transforms (rotation, zoom,
  blur) via B_SLIDER parameters. Subtle rotation on Pinwheel or zoom pulses
  on Shockwave timed to beats would add visual depth.
- **Render style options**: beyond Per Model Default, explore Per Model Per Preview
  and Per Model Single Line for different prop types.

### Section Transition Boundary Cleanup
- Some section boundaries from the segmentino + QM merge produce awkward
  transitions where effects cut abruptly or overlap in unexpected ways.
  Issues to investigate:
  - **Snap precision**: `_snap_sections_to_bars` uses a window of half the
    median bar interval. Some boundaries may snap to the wrong bar, creating
    short (<2s) or overlapping sub-sections.
  - **Effect crossfade at boundaries**: currently effects end exactly at the
    section boundary and the next section's effects start immediately. Adding
    a short crossfade (fade_out_ms on the outgoing effect, fade_in_ms on the
    incoming) would smooth transitions.
  - **Theme change at boundaries**: when a section changes themes (e.g. A→N5),
    the color palette and effect type change instantly. A 500ms blend or brief
    "Off" gap between sections would create cleaner visual transitions.
  - **QM merge edge cases**: QM boundaries very close to bar lines may create
    sub-sections that are too short to render a full effect cycle. The current
    min_gap_ms=5000 may need tuning per song tempo.
  - Test with more songs to identify systematic boundary issues vs one-offs.

### Custom Per-Song Themes
- Allow users to create custom themes tailored to specific songs, beyond the
  21 built-in themes. Implementation:
  - Custom theme JSON files in `~/.xlight/custom_themes/*.json` (the theme
    library loader already supports this path from feature 019)
  - A `--theme` CLI flag on `generate` to force a specific theme for all sections
  - A `--theme-file` flag to load a one-off theme JSON for a song
  - Theme wizard: interactive prompts to build a theme by choosing mood, palette
    colors, accent colors, base effect, upper effects, and blend modes
  - Theme preview: render a 10-second sample of each section with the chosen
    theme so users can evaluate before committing to a full sequence
  - Song-theme mapping: a config file that remembers which custom theme to use
    for each song (keyed by audio hash or filename)

### Explore Advanced Visual Effects
- Investigate underused xLights effects that could add visual interest:
  - **Kaleidoscope**: mirrors and rotates the underlying effect to create
    symmetrical patterns. Works as a modifier layer (blend on top of a base
    effect). Could be powerful on matrices and large groups where symmetry
    reads well.
  - **Warp**: distorts the effect buffer with swirl/ripple/dissolve transforms.
    Combined with a base like Color Wash or Plasma, could create organic
    evolving visuals. Currently only used in Molten Metal (removed).
  - **Spirograph**: mathematical curve patterns that animate over time.
    Visually striking on matrices but untested in our pipeline.
  - **Galaxy / Swirl patterns**: using Pinwheel with high twist + Kaleidoscope
    overlay could simulate galaxy/vortex effects for dramatic moments.
  - **Music-reactive modifiers**: Kaleidoscope size or Warp intensity driven
    by beat energy or spectral flux, so the visual distortion pulses with
    the music.
- These are best used sparingly as accent effects on hero props or during
  high-energy impact sections rather than as base layer backgrounds.
- Test each on different prop types (1D strings, 2D matrices, custom shapes)
  to determine suitability before adding to the effect pool.

## Engineering Principles

- **Favor real solutions over hacks.** Fix root causes, not symptoms. No `# HACK`,
  no `# TODO: fix this properly later`, no "temporary" workarounds that become permanent.
  If the right fix is too large for the current scope, say so — don't ship a band-aid.
- **Understand before changing.** Read the relevant code before proposing modifications.
  Trace the call chain. Check how existing callers use the function. Don't guess at behavior.
- **Don't over-engineer.** Solve the problem at hand. No speculative abstractions,
  premature generalization, or "just in case" parameters. Three similar lines are
  better than a clever helper used once.
- **Don't under-engineer either.** If the task requires proper error handling, tests,
  or data validation — do it. Cutting corners to save time creates debt that costs more later.
- **Keep changes minimal and focused.** A bug fix is a bug fix — don't refactor
  surrounding code, add type hints to untouched functions, or "improve" unrelated logic.
- **Test what matters.** Write tests for non-trivial logic, edge cases, and regressions.
  Don't write tests that just assert the implementation does what the implementation does.
- **Name things clearly.** Variable and function names should convey intent. If you need
  a comment to explain what a name means, the name is wrong.
- **No dead code.** Don't comment out code "for reference." Don't leave unused imports,
  variables, or functions. Git history exists for a reason.
