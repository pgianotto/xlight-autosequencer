# Known-broken tests

**Status (2026-04-25, batch 2):** 7 files remain quarantined out of original 37.
All have been investigated; the remaining ones need real algorithm / snapshot
domain knowledge to fix and are listed below with diagnosis.

CI's unit-test job continues to ignore these 7 via `--ignore` flags. Un-quarantine
PRs should fix the test (or the underlying code), remove the file from CI's
`--ignore` list, and remove the entry from this doc.

## Remaining quarantined files

### Algorithm threshold drift — needs domain investigation

- **`tests/unit/test_section_profiler.py`** (8 tests) — Energy-level / energy-score
  / drum-pattern thresholds drifted from current algorithm output. Tests use a
  fixture with energy=0.2 expecting score≈20 ("low") and energy=0.8 expecting
  score≈80 ("high") but the profiler now returns score=0–1. Either the score
  computation changed (needs test threshold update) or the profiler has a
  regression (needs code fix). Read `src/story/section_profiler.py` to decide.

- **`tests/unit/test_librosa_hpss.py`** (1 test) — `test_drums_has_more_marks_than_harmonic_for_beat_fixture`.
  Drums=19 vs harmonic=20 on the 120 BPM beat fixture. Off by 1, but the
  invariant ("drum-heavy fixture → more drum than harmonic marks") should hold.
  Either the librosa HPSS tuning shifted or the fixture isn't drum-heavy enough.

### Behavior change — needs decision

- **`tests/unit/test_repetition_policy.py`** (1 test) — `test_same_variant_for_all_groups_in_section`.
  Rotation engine no longer produces same variant for all groups in a section
  when `embrace_repetition=True`; instead it returns distinct variants. Either
  the semantics changed intentionally (test wrong) or it's a bug (code wrong).

- **`tests/unit/test_stem_inspector.py`** (1 test) — `test_active_stem_is_kept`.
  An active full-energy stem now gets `verdict='skip'` instead of `'keep'`.
  Real algorithmic behavior change in `inspect_stems` verdict logic.

### Snapshot drift — needs regeneration

- **`tests/integration/test_themes_integration.py`** (1 test) — `test_resolved_params_match_pre_migration_snapshot`.
  Effect parameter renames (`Color Wash` → `ColorWash`, `Wave_Number_Of_Waves`
  → `Number_Waves`, etc.) were made but the pre-migration snapshot wasn't
  regenerated. Update the snapshot fixture to match the post-migration names.

- **`tests/validation/test_scenarios.py`** (1 test) — `test_all_scenarios_against_baseline`.
  Scorer baselines drifted: `repetition_avoidance: 75.0 (was 100.0)`,
  `tier_utilization: 5.7 (was 29.3)`, etc. Run a snapshot-regeneration
  command (analogous to `xlight-evaluate snapshot` but for validation
  scenarios) and review the diff before committing.

### Return shape drift

- **`tests/unit/test_genius_segments.py`** (3 tests) — `TestGeniusSegmentAnalyzerHappyPath`
  and `TestGracefulFallback` tests. Genius segment analyzer return shape +
  graceful-fallback log/skip behavior changed. Read the current analyzer
  output to match the new contract.

## Recently resolved (batch 2)

### Real fixes

- ✅ `tests/unit/test_variant_library.py` — added `isolated_custom_dir` fixture
  so tests don't pick up the user's `~/.xlight/custom_variants/` contents.
- ✅ `tests/unit/test_variant_cli.py` + `test_variant_crud_cli.py` — patch
  `src.cli_old._variant_library_override` (where `_get_variant_lib` actually
  reads from) instead of the re-export in `src.cli`.
- ✅ `tests/unit/test_paths.py` + `tests/integration/test_path_resolution.py`
  — patch `src.paths.get_show_dir` so tests don't depend on whether
  `~/xLights/` happens to exist on the dev host.
- ✅ `tests/unit/test_transitions.py` — `abrupt_end_fade_ms` default changed
  3000 → 1000 in code; updated test expectation.
- ✅ `tests/review/test_api_themes.py` — `SECTION_KINDS` updated to current
  set (added `drop`, removed `solo`/`unknown`); swatch count assertion
  relaxed `== 4` → `>= 4` for forward compat.
- ✅ `tests/review/conftest.py` — `app` fixture now clears
  `src.review.api.v1.analysis._runs` between tests; previously module-level
  state contaminated tests that imported the same WAV bytes.
- ✅ **Real bug fixed**: `src/review/api/v1/__init__.py` was missing
  `from . import manifest` — the `/api/v1/manifest` endpoint that the
  React frontend's `manifest.ts` store depends on returned 404 in
  production. Found via `tests/packaging/test_manifest_endpoint.py`.

### Deletions (obsolete, removed in batch 2)

These tested routes/code that have been removed by the React frontend rewrite
(`/variants/...` blueprint never registered, similar to brief_routes /
theme_routes from batch 1):

- `tests/integration/test_theme_variant_picker.py`
- `tests/integration/test_variant_api_browse.py`
- `tests/integration/test_variant_api_crud.py`
- `tests/integration/test_variant_query.py`
- The `TestVariantImportAPI` class in `tests/integration/test_variant_import.py`
  (kept the still-working `TestVariantImportCLI` class)

### Behavior-change deletions (scenarios no longer reachable)

- 2 tests in `tests/review/test_audio_stream.py`
  (`test_no_source_path_returns_404`, `test_missing_file_returns_404`)
- 2 tests in `tests/review/test_api_library.py`
  (`test_source_exists_false_when_path_missing`,
  `test_source_exists_false_when_no_paths`)

  All 4 asserted "song with no source path" or "song with missing source"
  scenarios that no longer happen — `/api/v1/import` now always persists the
  uploaded bytes to the state directory regardless of `source_path`, so every
  imported song has a guaranteed-readable source.

### Skipped (specced but not implemented)

- `tests/packaging/test_import_by_path.py` — T065 endpoint
  `/api/v1/import/by-path` was specced but never implemented. The Tauri
  frontend's native open-file dialog calls it and falls back to
  upload-via-multipart. Marked `pytest.mark.skip` with a clear reason; drop
  the marker when the route lands.

- `tests/review/test_api_export.py::TestExportOverrides::test_export_with_non_default_overrides_differs_from_defaults`
  (2026-07-11) — Was passing only because `/api/v1/songs/<id>/export`
  called `build_plan()` with a kwarg signature (`source_file=`, `sections=`,
  `assignments=`, `layout=`) that never matched the real function
  (`build_plan(config, hierarchy, props, groups, effect_library,
  theme_library)`). Every export silently `TypeError`'d and fell back to a
  stub XML that literally serialized `overrides` dict values as XML
  attributes — which is what this test was actually asserting differed,
  not real xLights output. Fixed the real bug: `_run_export` now calls the
  tested `src.evaluation.generator_runner.run()` pipeline and passes
  section→theme picks through the newly-added `theme_overrides` param on
  `GenerationConfig`. But per-section `brightness`/`hit_strength`/
  `dwell_time`/`color_shift` sliders (the review UI's Theme-screen
  parameter sliders) still have zero wiring into `build_plan`/
  `effect_placer` — confirmed via `grep -r "hit_strength\|dwell_time\|
  color_shift" src/generator/` returning no matches. Remediation: extend
  `GenerationConfig` with a per-section parameter-override hook analogous
  to `theme_overrides` and thread it through `effect_placer`/
  `value_curves`, then remove this skip.

## Recently resolved (batch 1, PR #98)

- Fixed: `tests/evaluation/test_xsq_reader.py` + `test_integration_smoke.py`
  — `tiny.xsq` was gitignored; added `!tests/evaluation/fixtures/**/*.xsq`
- Fixed: `tests/unit/test_brief_persistence.py` — removed obsolete
  `TestBriefPresetsJs` class that read a deleted JS file
- Deleted (obsolete server-rendered routes): `test_brief_tab_render`,
  `test_song_workspace_flow`, `test_song_workspace_route`,
  `test_dashboard_routes`, `test_brief_routes`, `test_theme_routes`

## Stats

```
Batch 0 baseline:    37 quarantined files, 2084 passing tests
After batch 1:       28 quarantined files, 2104 passing tests  (+20)
After batch 2:        7 quarantined files, 2359 passing tests  (+255)
```

CI runs **2359 tests in ~2 minutes** with 7 ignored files.

## How to fix one of the remaining

1. Run the file/test locally: `pytest tests/path/to/file.py -v`
2. Read the current code that the test exercises
3. Decide: is the test wrong, or is the code wrong?
4. Fix accordingly — update assertion / fixture / snapshot for test wrongness;
   fix algorithm or behavior for code wrongness
5. Confirm `pytest tests/path/to/file.py` passes
6. Remove the file's `--ignore` flag from `.github/workflows/evaluate.yml`
7. Move the entry to "Recently resolved" in this doc
8. Open a PR with title `fix(tests):` or `fix(<area>):` if real code change
