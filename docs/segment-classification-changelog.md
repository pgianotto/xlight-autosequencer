## 2026-03-31 — Genius quality gate (fallback to heuristics)

**Files:** `src/story/builder.py`

**Problem:** Genius returns poor section data for classical, instrumental, or non-English
songs. Carmina Burana matched TSO's version with Latin section headers (`[Introductio]`,
`[Versum I]`, etc.) — only 4 sections, with Versum II+III merging into a 60-second
"verse" that covers 37% of the song. The heuristic path (segmentino A×3 + N×3 + QM
boundaries) would have produced better results.

**Quality checks added (`_genius_quality_ok()`):**
- Reject if <3 sections for songs >60s
- Reject if any single section covers >60% of song duration
- Reject if fewer than 2 distinct roles (all mapped to same role)
- Reject if >50% of sections are <3s (bad WhisperX alignment)

When Genius data fails the quality gate, `section_source` is set to `"heuristic"` and
the segmentino+energy classifier runs instead.

## 2026-03-31 — Implicit intro/outro detection for Genius sections

**Files:** `src/story/builder.py`

**Problem:** Genius sections don't include `[Intro]` or `[Outro]` tags for most songs.
The first Genius section starts at the first lyric (e.g. 10s into the song), leaving
the instrumental intro unaccounted for. The last section runs all the way to the song
duration, even when the song clearly fades out — e.g. Santa Tell Me's last "chorus"
was 52 seconds because Genius had no `[Outro]` after the final `[Chorus]`.

**Energy analysis (Santa Tell Me tail):**
```
02:30 → energy=36.3
02:50 → energy=38.7
03:00 → energy=26.1  ← drop starts here
03:10 → energy=23.6
03:20 → energy=5.6   ← clearly an outro
```

**Changes:**
1. **Implicit intro**: If the first Genius section starts >3s into the song, insert an
   `intro` section from 0 to that start time.
2. **Implicit outro**: If the last section is >15s long and the energy in its tail (last
   15s) drops below 60% of its first-half energy, scan backwards to find the crossover
   point and split off an `outro` section.

**Note:** This only applies to Genius-sourced sections. The heuristic fallback already
handles intro/outro via positional rules.

## 2026-03-31 — Genius user prompt on lookup failure

**Files:** `src/review/server.py`, `src/review/static/upload.js`, `src/review/static/upload.html`,
`src/analyzer/genius_segments.py`

**Problem:** When a song had no ID3 tags and the filename-derived title didn't match
Genius, the Genius lookup silently failed and fell back to heuristics. The user had
no opportunity to correct the search.

**Changes:**
1. `genius_segments.py` — Falls back to filename when ID3 tags are missing. Supports
   `_GENIUS_OVERRIDE_ARTIST` / `_GENIUS_OVERRIDE_TITLE` env vars for user-provided values.
2. `server.py` — After story build, if `section_source != "genius"`, emits a
   `genius_prompt` SSE event with the guessed artist/title. Background thread blocks
   on `threading.Event` waiting for user response. New `/genius-retry` endpoint
   receives the user's artist/title and unblocks the thread.
3. `upload.js` — Handles `genius_prompt` event: shows a purple form with artist/title
   fields and Search/Skip buttons. Search posts to `/genius-retry`; Skip sends
   `__skip__` sentinel.
4. `upload.html` — CSS for the Genius prompt form.

## 2026-03-31 — Genius lyrics as primary section source

**Files:** `src/story/builder.py`, `src/story/section_classifier.py`, `scripts/compare_genius_sections.py`

**Problem:** Genius comparison on Ghostbusters revealed energy+segmentino heuristics
produce structurally wrong results when a song's energy profile doesn't match
conventional verse/chorus expectations.

**Comparison output (Ghostbusters):**

```
Genius sequence (12 sections):
  intro → verse → chorus → verse → chorus → verse → bridge → verse → interlude → chorus → verse → outro

Our sequence (11 sections):
  intro → chorus → verse → pre_chorus → chorus → verse → pre_chorus → chorus → verse → pre_chorus → outro
```

**Specific failures:**
1. **Our "pre_chorus" = Genius "chorus"** — "I ain't afraid of no ghost" IS the chorus.
   Energy heuristics classified it as pre_chorus because it's lower energy than the
   "Ghostbusters!" call-and-response verses.
2. **Our "chorus" at s02 = Genius "verse"** — The high-energy "Ghostbusters!" hook is
   part of the verses, not a standalone chorus. Energy-based classifier inverted this.
3. **93-second s09 "verse"** — One merged section swallowed 6 Genius sections: verse 3,
   bridge, verse 4, interlude, chorus, and verse 5. The consecutive-same-role merger
   from the earlier change collapsed too aggressively when the heuristic got the base
   labels wrong.
4. **Missing bridge and interlude** — Genius has both; we produced neither. The segmentino
   boundaries for that range were merged into one giant section.
5. **3 phantom "pre_chorus" sections** — Genius has zero pre-choruses. Our label-aware
   classifier invented them by assuming sections before the (wrongly labeled) "chorus"
   must be pre-choruses.

**Root causes:**
- Energy heuristics assume chorus = high energy. Ghostbusters has high-energy verses
  ("Ghostbusters!") and lower-energy choruses ("I ain't afraid of no ghost").
- Segmentino labels (A, B, C) indicate musical repetition but not lyric function.
  The most-repeated high-energy label being "chorus" is an assumption that fails here.
- Without lyric text, there's no way to know what the section actually IS — energy
  and repetition patterns are insufficient.

**Fix:** When Genius API data is available, use it as the primary source for section
labels (chorus, verse, bridge, etc.) instead of guessing from energy+segmentino.
Fall back to heuristics only when Genius isn't available.

**Changes:**
1. `builder.py` — When `GENIUS_API_TOKEN` is set, fetch Genius lyrics, parse section
   headers, and use WhisperX forced alignment to map each lyric section to a time
   range. These become the primary section boundaries and roles.
2. `section_classifier.py` — Energy heuristics remain as fallback when Genius is
   unavailable.
3. Added `scripts/compare_genius_sections.py` — diagnostic tool to compare Genius
   sections against our classifier output for any song.

## 2026-03-31 — Energy scale fix (0–100 not 0–1)

**Files:** `src/story/section_profiler.py`, `src/story/section_classifier.py`

**Problem:** Every section had `energy_score=100`. The profiler multiplied 0–100 curve
values by 100 (treating them as 0.0–1.0 floats), clamping everything to 100.
The classifier's thresholds (0.05, 0.3, 0.65) were also calibrated for 0–1 but received
0–100 values, making every section appear high-energy and vocal.

**Changes:**
1. `section_profiler.py` — Removed `* 100` from `energy_score` and `energy_peak`.
   Normalized variance to 0–1 by dividing by 2500 (max possible for 0–100 range).
2. `section_classifier.py` — `_avg_curve()` now normalizes values >1.0 to 0.0–1.0
   by dividing by 100, so thresholds work correctly.

---

## 2026-03-31 — Label-aware classifier + consecutive merge

**Files:** `src/story/section_classifier.py`, `src/story/builder.py`

**Problem:** Too many sections labeled "verse". For Ghostbusters, nearly every vocal
section was classified as verse because the classifier only had two paths for vocal
sections: chorus (top 40% energy) or verse (everything else). Songs with uniform
high energy had almost no sections clear the chorus threshold.

**Root cause:**
- Binary vocal classification — `pre_chorus`, `bridge`, `post_chorus` were defined
  in `VALID_ROLES` but never assigned by any code path.
- Chorus threshold `vocal_median + 0.6 × (vocal_max − vocal_median)` was too strict
  (required top 40% of energy range). Uniform-energy songs produced few choruses.
- Segmentino's own repetition labels (A, B, C…) were extracted and stored but never
  used by the classifier.
- No post-processing to collapse consecutive same-role sections.

**Changes:**
1. `section_classifier.py` — New `_classify_by_labels()` path (used when segmentino
   labels are available):
   - Groups sections by segmentino label; computes per-label average energy and count.
   - Most-repeated high-energy vocal label → `chorus`.
   - Section immediately before a chorus-label section → `pre_chorus`.
   - Vocal label that appears only once and follows a chorus → `bridge`.
   - Fallback heuristic chorus threshold loosened from top-40% to top-25% of energy range.
2. `builder.py` — Extracts segmentino labels per boundary and maps dominant label to
   each merged section. Passes `section_labels` to `classify_section_roles()`.
3. `builder.py` — Post-classification step merges consecutive sections with the same
   role into one (collapses segmentino over-splits within a single musical section).

**Note:** Multiple distinct verses are still correct and expected when there are genuine
musical differences between them (different lyrics, energy trajectory, etc.). The merge
only collapses *adjacent* same-role sections with no different role between them.

---

## 2026-03-26 — Initial section classification (baseline)

**Files:** `src/story/section_classifier.py`, `src/story/section_merger.py`, `src/story/builder.py`

**Approach:**
- `section_merger.py`: Merges raw segmentino boundaries into 8–15 sections
  (`min_duration_ms=4000`, `target_max=15`). Short sections (<4s) are absorbed
  into their shorter neighbour. Excess sections merged by shortest-combined-duration.
- `section_classifier.py`: Energy + vocal heuristics only.
  - No vocals anywhere → instrumental fallback (intro / instrumental_break / interlude / outro).
  - Vocal sections: top 40% of vocal-energy range → `chorus`; remainder → `verse`.
  - Non-vocal sections mid-song: `instrumental_break` if surrounded by vocal sections,
    else `interlude`. First section → `intro`. Last section → `outro`.
- `builder.py`: Extracted raw boundaries from `hierarchy["sections"]` (segmentino marks),
  passed timestamps only (labels discarded) to `merge_sections()` then `classify_section_roles()`.

**Known limitations at time of writing:**
- `pre_chorus`, `bridge`, `post_chorus` never assigned.
- Segmentino labels ignored.
- Uniform-energy songs produce too many verses.
- No consecutive same-role merging.

## 2026-04-28 — Lyric-anchored boundary refinement (three fixes)

**OpenSpec change:** `openspec/changes/lyric-anchored-boundary-refinement/`
(spec PR #126).

**Files:** `src/analyzer/free_transcription.py` (new), `src/story/boundary_refinement.py`
(new), `src/story/builder.py` (call site), `src/review/api/v1/analysis.py`
(payload surfacing).

A new post-classification refinement pass runs after section roles are assigned
and before `_story.json` is written. Consumes WhisperX forced-alignment word
marks (already used by Genius alignment) and a free-transcription word stream
(no Genius required) as ground-truth "is anyone audibly singing here" evidence.
Each section gains a `boundary_refinements: list[str]` field accumulating
human-readable notes from each pass. Schema bumped to `1.1.0` (additive).
Empirical record on 16-song corpus: 8 fires across 5 songs, 0 false positives.

### Fix 1 — `merge_short_post_chorus_tail`

Merges a short trailing `post_chorus` back into the prior chorus thought when
the audio shows continuous vocals across the boundary. Preconditions: prior
section role in `{verse, chorus, pre_chorus, bridge}`, next section role is
`post_chorus`, next duration `< 6000 ms`, next `agreement_score <= 1`, and
the gap from the prior section's last forced-aligned word to the next
section's first forced-aligned word is `<= 1500 ms`. When all hold, the prior
section's `end_ms` extends to the next section's last word + 250 ms tail and
the next section is dropped. Reasoning: a continuous low-agreement post_chorus
of `<` six seconds with no audible silence gap is the same chorus thought,
not a separate post-chorus role. (~85 words)

### Fix 2 — `relabel_or_split_bridge`

Verifies "bridge" sections actually contain non-chorus material by checking
for the chorus's first-line distinctive hook (≥ 3-character, non-stopword
words, in order, within a 12-word sliding window, requiring N-1 of N matches
so a single ASR drop doesn't abort). Stopword set covers high-frequency
function words plus common contractions (`i'm`, `you're`, `we're`, `it's`,
`we'll`, `i'll`, `going`, `off`). Four branches: (a) hook present, no large
internal vocal gap → relabel the whole section to `chorus`; (b) hook present
in both halves around a `>= 3000 ms` gap → relabel; (c) hook present in
prefix only with a gap → split (keep prefix as chorus, leave remainder as
bridge); (d) no hook match → leave unchanged. Skipped silently when chorus
body has fewer than two distinctive targets. (~95 words)

### Fix 3 — `split_pre_vocal_instrumental`

Splits an instrumental lead-in off the front of a vocal section when the
audio shows a long silence before any singing. Preconditions: section role
in the vocal kinds set; section label does not contain `"instrumental"` or
`"break"` (case-insensitive guard against double-splitting an
already-instrumental section); section has at least one free-transcribed
word; gap from `section.start_ms` to first transcribed word's `start_ms`
is `>= 5000 ms` AND the remainder `(section.end_ms - first_word.start_ms)`
is `>= 3000 ms` (mislabeled-section guard — too little vocal content
remaining means the entire section is probably instrumental). When all hold,
insert a synthetic `instrumental` section from `section.start_ms` to
`first_word.start_ms - 250 ms` and shift the section's start to that
boundary. Reasoning: a five-second-plus pre-vocal gap inside a "verse" is
audibly an intro/break, not part of the verse. (~95 words)

## 2026-07-11 — Genius lyrics integration removed entirely

**Files:** `src/analyzer/genius_segments.py` (deleted), `src/story/builder.py`,
`src/analyzer/capabilities.py`, `src/review/server.py`,
`src/review/api/v1/analysis.py`, `src/review/api/v1/library.py`,
`src/wizard.py`, `src/cli/analyze.py`, `src/cli/library.py`, `src/cli_old.py`

**Problem:** `genius.com/api-clients` (the page needed to obtain a
`GENIUS_API_TOKEN`) was returning a server-side "Whoops! Something went
wrong" error and could not be used to provision a token. Independent of that
outage, this project's only path to Genius-sourced section labels
(`section_source == "genius"`) required a token in the environment; with no
token configured on this deployment, `section_source` was *already* always
`"heuristic"` in practice — this change makes that the only path, instead of
a fallback.

**What was removed:**
- `GeniusSegmentAnalyzer` (fetch Genius lyrics via `lyricsgenius`, parse
  `[Section]` headers, WhisperX-force-align the fetched lyric text to audio)
  and its quality gate (`_genius_quality_check`, added 2026-03-31) and
  implicit intro/outro post-processing for Genius sections (added
  2026-03-31, see above) — those steps only ever ran on the now-deleted
  Genius branch.
- `_normalize_genius_label` / `_GENIUS_ROLE_MAP` (Genius label → role
  vocabulary) — no longer has any input to normalize.
- The web UI's ID3-confirm-before-Genius gate and Genius-retry prompt
  (`prompt_id3_confirm`/`prompt_genius` events, `/genius-retry`,
  `/id3-confirm`, `/analyze/id3-confirm`, `/songs/<id>/id3-tags`,
  `PATCH /songs/<id>/metadata`) — these existed solely to correct
  artist/title before a Genius lookup or retry it with corrected metadata.
- The CLI wizard's Genius step (`WizardRunner._step_genius`, the
  `--genius/--no-genius` flag) and the `_GENIUS_ALLOW_TITLE_ONLY_FALLBACK`
  env-var plumbing in `src/cli/library.py`'s `refresh` command.
- The `lyricsgenius` dependency (`pyproject.toml`, `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`).

**What changed in `build_song_story`:** `section_source` is now a hardcoded
`"heuristic"` constant (schema field kept for downstream compatibility —
readers that check this field are unaffected). Genius's forced-aligned word
marks and parsed chorus body are gone, so `boundary_refinement.py`'s **Fix 1**
(merge short post_chorus tails) and **Fix 2** (relabel/split a bridge whose
sung content opens with the chorus first-line hook) are now **permanently
inactive** — both required text known in advance to force-align or match
against, which only Genius provided. **Fix 3** (split a pre-vocal
instrumental lead-in off a vocal section) only ever needed free-transcription
word marks (no reference text), so it was re-wired to run as a standalone
WhisperX pass (`_try_free_transcription` in `src/story/builder.py`) instead
of being nested inside the Genius pipeline, and continues to fire.

**Do not re-add** a dependency on `genius.com`/`lyricsgenius` to restore
Fix 1/Fix 2 without re-reading this entry — the heuristic + agreement-cluster
path (`src/analyzer/boundary_cluster.py`) is the sole, load-bearing section
source for every user of this project as of this change, not a fallback, so
any future reintroduction must not regress the assumption that
`section_source` is always `"heuristic"`.

---

## 2026-07-11 — Fix 1/Fix 2 restored via `syncedlyrics` (no genius.com access)

**Files:** `src/analyzer/synced_lyrics.py` (new), `src/story/builder.py`,
`pyproject.toml`

**Problem:** The 2026-07-11 Genius removal (previous entry) left
boundary-refinement Fix 1 (merge short post_chorus tails) and Fix 2
(relabel/split a bridge whose sung content opens with the chorus first-line
hook) permanently inactive, since both need forced-aligned lyric text and a
known chorus body that only Genius provided.

**Fix:** `syncedlyrics` (a token-free, multi-provider LRC lyrics aggregator
— lrclib, Musixmatch, NetEase, Deezer, Megalobiz, Lyricsify) supplies
line-timed lyric text without any API token or account. Two alternatives
were evaluated and rejected first:
- Scraping `genius.com` directly (`syncedlyrics` even ships a Genius
  provider) — rejected; this project does not access genius.com in any
  form. The provider allowlist in `synced_lyrics.py`
  (`_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS`) explicitly excludes it.
- `essentia`'s `SBic` structural segmenter, considered as a vamp-independent
  boundary-detection fallback for the unrelated "single giant Intro
  section" bug (heuristic mode has no boundary source at all without the
  vamp `segmentino`/`qm_segments` plugins) — rejected: essentia has no
  prebuilt Windows wheel and fails to build from source on Windows, so it
  would only ever run in the same Linux devcontainer where vamp already
  works, making it redundant with vamp's segmenter there and useless as a
  Windows-native fallback. That vamp-availability gap is addressed by using
  the devcontainer, not by this change.

**Key difference from Genius:** LRC format has no `[Chorus]`/`[Verse]`
structural headers — `syncedlyrics` only supplies line-timed text, not
section labels. `find_chorus_body()` in `synced_lyrics.py` derives a
best-guess chorus block by finding the most-repeated contiguous 2-line
window in the lyric text (a chorus repeats near-verbatim; a verse doesn't).
This is a heuristic proxy for what Genius's explicit `[Chorus]` header gave
directly — worth revisiting if Fix 2's false-positive/negative rate on a
larger corpus suggests the repetition heuristic needs tightening.

**Not restored:** `section_source` remains hardcoded `"heuristic"` (previous
entry) — this change only feeds the two refinement fixes, it does not
reinstate Genius-style primary section-boundary detection from lyrics.

---

## 2026-07-11 — Synced lyrics exposed as a Timeline track (`story["lyrics"]`)

**Files:** `src/analyzer/synced_lyrics.py`, `src/story/builder.py`,
`src/analyzer/result.py`, `src/review/api/v1/analysis.py`,
`src/review/frontend/src/screens/Timeline.tsx`

**Problem:** The `syncedlyrics` line data fetched by
`get_boundary_refinement_inputs()` (previous entry) was only ever consumed
internally by Fix 1/Fix 2 and then discarded — it never reached the story
dict, the analysis JSON, or the UI, so users had no visible lyric track
despite the lookup already running on every song.

**Change:** `get_boundary_refinement_inputs()` now returns a 3-tuple
(`forced_words`, `chorus_body`, `line_marks`) instead of 2 — `line_marks` is
one `TimingMark` per LRC line (`lines_to_timing_marks()`, new), reusing the
same parsed `(start_ms, text)` lines rather than re-fetching. `builder.py`
attaches these to `story["lyrics"]` as `[{t_ms, duration_ms, text}, ...]`
(empty list when no match — this is NOT a boundary-detection signal, purely
a display track, so an empty result is not a capability-skip warning).
**No change to section detection, merging, or role classification** — this
entry exists only because it modifies the same Step 15c call site as the
2026-07-11 Fix 1/Fix 2 entry above and touches `builder.py`.

## 2026-07-21 — `story["lyrics_text_found"]` flag added

**Files:** `src/story/builder.py`, `src/review/api/v1/analysis.py`,
`src/review/frontend/src/screens/Timeline.tsx`,
`src/review/frontend/src/components/LyricTrack/LyricTrack.tsx`

**Problem:** The "Paste Lyrics" fallback (added earlier the same day for
songs no `syncedlyrics` provider has indexed) feeds plain, untimed text
into the same `lyrics_text_override` path a timed provider result uses.
Plain text produces a `chorus_body` (used by boundary-refinement Fix 2)
but zero `lyric_line_marks`, so `story["lyrics"]` — the Timeline's
`LyricTrack` display track — comes back empty exactly the same as when
nothing was found at all. A user who successfully pasted lyrics that
correctly drove chorus/section detection still saw the Timeline's
"No synced lyrics found" message, indistinguishable from a total failure
(user-reported confusion testing "Shake the Snowglobe").

**Change:** `story["lyrics_text_found"] = bool(chorus_body)` — true
whenever *some* lyric text contributed to section detection, even
without per-line timing. Threaded through the three places
`analysis.py` assembles/persists the API response's `lyrics` list (the
initial analyze-stream result + session save, the analyze-commit
carry-through, and the cached-session GET path) so it survives the
same way `lyrics_list` already does. `LyricTrack` now shows "Lyrics
found (no timing)" instead of the generic empty message when
`lyrics_text_found` is true but there are no timed lines to render —
deliberately not phrased as "pasted" specifically, since an untimed
plain-text *provider* result (a separate, already-documented case) hits
this exact same flag/branch and can't be told apart from a user paste at
this layer.
**No change to section detection, merging, or role classification** —
purely a display-layer flag riding the same `chorus_body` value Fix 2
already computes; nothing about what qualifies as a chorus match changed.

## 2026-07-25 — Packaged desktop app: demucs/madmom sidecar bug collapsed every song to one flat section

**Files:** `src/analyzer/stems.py`, `src/analyzer/runner.py`, `src/analyzer/orchestrator.py`

**Problem:** In the packaged Tauri desktop app, `StemSeparator._run_demucs` and
`AnalysisRunner.run` both unconditionally shelled out to a `.venv-vamp` sidecar
virtualenv (the devcontainer dev-mode layout) to run demucs/madmom, even though
the packaged app bundles demucs/madmom/torch directly into the single PyInstaller
executable and they import fine in-process there. Since `.venv-vamp` doesn't
exist in the packaged app, stem separation failed immediately and every
madmom-based algorithm (beats, downbeats) silently produced zero marks —
`capabilities.py`'s detection correctly reported demucs/madmom as available, but
the actual execution paths never checked that before dispatching to the sidecar.
Result: `algorithms_run: []`, no beat/bar tracks, no sections — the story builder
had nothing to segment on and collapsed every song into one flat "intro" section
spanning the whole track (user report: "no sections detected at all").

**Fix:** Both now try an in-process import first (`import demucs, torch` /
`import madmom` + `patch_madmom_compat()`), only falling back to the
`.venv-vamp` subprocess when the import genuinely fails (the dev-mode
main-venv case). Verified against a real song: demucs produces real non-zero
stems (previously all zeros) and madmom produces 432 beat marks / 108 downbeat
marks (previously zero) — `run_orchestrator(fresh=True)` then produces real
sections instead of one flat "intro".

**Cache invalidation gotcha (bug-265 lesson repeated):** a normal "Reanalyze"
click passes `fresh=False`, so `run_orchestrator` returns whatever cached
`_hierarchy.json` matches source_hash+schema_version *without checking its
content* — any song already analyzed once in the packaged app before this fix
has a cached `algorithms_run: []` result that silently kept being re-served on
every subsequent reanalyze, making the fix look like it hadn't worked at all
until `SCHEMA_VERSION` was bumped (2.6.0 → 2.7.0) to invalidate those stale
caches.

**No change to section detection, merging, or role classification logic
itself** — this entry qualifies for the log because the orchestrator change
affects whether any beat/bar/section data reaches the story builder at all,
not because the classification rules changed.

## 2026-09-22 — Segmentino label loss (default-output bug) + merge collapse cap

**OpenSpec change:** `openspec/changes/segmentino-label-extraction/`

**Files:** `src/analyzer/algorithms/vamp_segmentation.py`,
`src/analyzer/orchestrator.py`, `src/story/builder.py`.

**Problem, diagnosed on a real song in production use** (`e0f7a3435bd3296c`,
"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" — Andy Williams, 152.6s):
detected as 3 sections, one spanning 0–126.2s — 83% of the entire song.

Traced through the real hierarchy/story JSON: the raw boundary detector
found 8 reasonable, evenly-spaced marks (0.2s, 9.6s, 49s, 70s, 77s, 115s,
126s, 140s) — correct. Every one had `label: null`, even though
`algorithms_run` confirmed `segmentino` executed. Root cause:
`SegmentinoAlgorithm._run()` called `vamp.collect(audio, sample_rate,
self.plugin_key, parameters=self.parameters)` with **no `output=`
argument**. Every other structural/multi-output Vamp wrapper in this
codebase explicitly selects an output — `QMSegmenterAlgorithm` (the
sibling structural segmenter) sets `vamp_output = "segmentation"`;
`vamp_beats.py`, `vamp_onsets.py`, `vamp_pitch.py`, `vamp_harmony.py`
(chordino, whose labels *do* work today) all pass `output=`. Segmentino
was the one wrapper relying on Vamp's default output, which for a
multi-output plugin is not guaranteed to be the labelled one.

With every mark unlabeled, `builder.py`'s `_dominant_label()` finds no
candidates for any segment, forcing `section_classifier.py` down the
weaker energy-percentile-only fallback (top ~25% energy → chorus, rest →
verse) for **every song this bug affects**, not just the diagnosed one.
On this song's fairly uniform dynamics, 6 of 8 segments fell below the
chorus threshold, all labelled `verse`, and Step 4b's consecutive-same-
role merge (which exists specifically to collapse segmentino's normal
over-splitting) glued all 6 into one block — the *exact* failure shape
already logged above under "2026-03-31 — Label-aware classifier +
consecutive merge" (Ghostbusters, "93-second s09 'verse'... swallowed 6
sections"), reproducing live on a different song, under a different
trigger, roughly six months later.

**Fix:**
1. `vamp_segmentation.py` — added explicit `vamp_output = "segmentation"`
   (matching `QMSegmenterAlgorithm`'s convention) and `output=self.vamp_output`
   on the `vamp.collect()` call. **The exact output ID is a best guess
   pending live confirmation** — `vamp` has no native host library outside
   the Linux dev container, so this repo's Windows dev environment could
   not run `vamp.list_outputs_of("segmentino:segmentino")` to verify it
   directly. If the real ID differs, update `vamp_output` accordingly —
   do not assume this entry's guess was correct without checking.
2. `orchestrator.py` — added a warning when segmentino runs but returns
   zero labelled marks, so a future regression here is visible in
   `result.warnings` (already surfaced in the UI) instead of silently
   degrading section quality the way this one did for an unknown length
   of time.
3. `builder.py` Step 4b — capped the consecutive-same-role merge at
   `_MAX_MERGED_SECTION_FRACTION = 0.5` (50%) of song duration, independent
   of fix #1. Same spirit as the existing `_genius_quality_ok()` gate
   ("reject if any single section covers >60% of song duration") — now
   also enforced at the point the collapse actually happens, so a total
   role-classification failure from *any* future cause can't reproduce
   this exact shape again.

`SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 2.7.0 → 2.8.0 (hierarchy) and story schema 1.1.0 →
1.2.0, per the established bug-265 reasoning — old caches silently keep
re-serving the unlabeled/uncapped result under `fresh=False` otherwise.

**Deliberately out of scope, follow-ups if this doesn't fully resolve
label loss:** `section_classifier.py`'s energy-threshold tuning (top-25%
= chorus) and using `boundary_cluster.py`'s agreement scores to drive
merge decisions rather than just score them after the fact — both remain
real, separate candidates once this stops masking whether either is the
next weakest link.
