# OpenWolf Operating Protocol

You are working in an OpenWolf-managed project. These rules apply every turn.

## STATUS.md — Single Source of Truth (READ FIRST)

`.wolf/STATUS.md` is the **first file** you read when resuming a session. It contains:
- ✅ What is concluded (current quest finished)
- 🚀 Next quest (objective, files to create, decisions fixed/pending)
- 📁 Active architecture (stack, tables, patterns)
- ⚠️ External pendencies
- 🔧 Useful commands

**At session start:** read `.wolf/STATUS.md` first. It replaces re-reading memory.md, plans, and code to reconstruct context.

**MANDATORY — keep STATUS.md fresh:**
1. When the user signals a quest is done ("done", "complete", "ship it", "next phase", "/clear", "wrap up"):
   - Move just-finished items from `🚀 Próxima fase` → `✅ Concluído`.
   - Replace `🚀 Próxima fase` with the next planned quest (objective, files, decisions).
   - Bump "Last updated" date.
2. After applying a migration, scaffolding a feature, or finishing a multi-file task: update STATUS.md before responding "done".
3. Before suggesting `/clear` to the user, ensure STATUS.md reflects the current state.

**The bar is HIGH for STATUS.md.** Stale STATUS.md = wasted next session. Always treat it as the handoff document.

## File Navigation

1. Check `.wolf/anatomy.md` BEFORE reading any file. It has a 2-3 line description and token estimate for every file in the project.
2. If the description in anatomy.md is sufficient for your task, do NOT read the full file.
3. If a file is not in anatomy.md, search with Grep/Glob. anatomy.md is rendered from `.wolf/anatomy-index.json`; you may edit descriptions in anatomy.md (they are absorbed on the next update) but do not reorder or reformat it. Regenerate with `openwolf scan`.

## Code Generation

1. Before generating code, read `.wolf/cerebrum.md` and respect every entry.
2. Check the `## Do-Not-Repeat` section — these are past mistakes that must not recur.
3. Follow all conventions in `## Key Learnings` and `## User Preferences`.

## After Actions

1. After every significant action, append a one-line entry to `.wolf/memory.md`:
   `| HH:MM | description | file(s) | outcome | ~tokens |`
2. After creating, deleting, or renaming files: update `.wolf/anatomy.md`.

## Cerebrum Learning (MANDATORY — every session)

OpenWolf's value comes from learning across sessions. You MUST update `.wolf/cerebrum.md` whenever you learn something useful. This is not optional.

**Update `## User Preferences` when the user:**
- Corrects your approach ("no, do it this way instead")
- Expresses a style preference (naming, structure, formatting)
- Shows a preferred workflow or tool choice
- Rejects a suggestion — record what they preferred instead
- Asks for more/less detail, verbosity, explanation

**Update `## Key Learnings` when you discover:**
- A project convention not obvious from the code (e.g., "tests go in __tests__/ not test/")
- A framework-specific pattern this project uses
- An API behavior that surprised you
- A dependency quirk or version constraint
- How modules connect or data flows through the system

**Update `## Do-Not-Repeat` (with date) when:**
- The user corrects a mistake you made
- You try something that fails and find the right approach
- You discover a gotcha that would trip up a fresh session

**Update `## Decision Log` when:**
- A significant architectural or technical choice is made
- The user explains why they chose approach A over B
- A trade-off is explicitly discussed

**The bar is LOW.** If in doubt, add it. A cerebrum entry that's slightly redundant costs nothing. A missing entry means the next session repeats the same discovery process.

## Bug Logging (MANDATORY)

**Log a bug to `.wolf/buglog.json` whenever ANY of these happen:**
- The user reports an error, bug, or problem
- A test fails or a command produces an error
- You fix something that was broken
- You edit a file more than twice to get it right
- An import, module, or dependency is missing or wrong
- A runtime error, type error, or syntax error occurs
- A build or lint command fails
- A feature doesn't work as expected
- You change error handling, try/catch blocks, or validation logic
- The user says something "doesn't work", "is broken", or "shows wrong X"

**Before fixing:** Read `.wolf/buglog.json` first — the fix may already be known.

**After fixing:** ALWAYS append to `.wolf/buglog.json` with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "bug-NNN",
  "timestamp": "ISO date",
  "error_message": "exact error or user complaint",
  "file": "file that was fixed",
  "root_cause": "why it broke",
  "fix": "what you changed to fix it",
  "tags": ["relevant", "keywords"],
  "related_bugs": [],
  "occurrences": 1,
  "last_seen": "ISO date"
}
```

**The threshold is LOW.** When in doubt, log it. A false positive in the bug log costs nothing. A missed bug means repeating the same mistake later.

## Branch Discipline

**Never work directly on `main` or `master`.** Every new task gets a new branch.

- Before starting any code change, check `git branch --show-current`. If on `main`/`master`, create a new branch first:
  - `fix/<slug>` for bug fixes
  - `feat/<slug>` for new features
  - `refactor/<slug>` for pure refactors
  - `chore/<slug>` for tooling/docs
- If already on a feature branch, verify the new task is part of the same logical change. If it isn't, stop and create a new branch.
- Do not commit unrelated work to an existing feature branch — open a new branch off `main`.
- Before merging any branch: run `/review-diff` and resolve every CRITICAL and HIGH finding.

## Code Review Discipline

When asked to review a branch, PR, or diff — or as a final gate before merge — apply these adversarial passes. Be suspicious, not agreeable.

### 1. Intent conformance (did we do what was asked, no more, no less?)

- Restate the goal in one sentence. If a spec in `specs/` applies, use its summary.
- For each hunk in the diff, ask: does this advance that one sentence?
  - If no: flag as **SCOPE DRIFT** with `file:line` and why it doesn't fit.
- Is anything in the stated goal *not* addressed by the diff? Flag as **INCOMPLETE**.
- Did the implementation silently pick a different approach than the plan? Flag as **APPROACH DRIFT**.
- Unrelated renames, moves, formatting changes, import reorderings: **SCOPE DRIFT** unless the task explicitly asked for them.

### 2. Regression surface (did we break something that was working?)

- List every modified public symbol (module-level function, class method, CLI command/arg, JSON/XML schema field).
- For each: grep callers across `src/` and `tests/`. Flag callers not updated as **BROKEN CALLER**.
- List every modified file. For each: identify the feature(s) it belongs to (cross-reference `specs/` and neighboring modules), and check whether tests cover the pre-change behavior. If not: **UNCOVERED CHANGE**.
- Signature changes (parameters added/removed/reordered, return type changed, default value changed): enumerate every caller, not just the ones in the diff.
- Changes to shared infrastructure (`src/generator/`, `src/analyzer/`, `src/story/`, `src/themes/`, `src/effects/`): list which features share the module and confirm their tests still pass.

### 3. Root-cause discipline (is this a real fix or a band-aid?)

For any bug fix: the diff description (or commit message) MUST state the root cause in one sentence — "X happens because Y." If absent, flag **UNDIAGNOSED FIX**.

Scan the diff for symptom-fix anti-patterns and flag each:

- **SWALLOWED ERROR**: new `try/except` with `pass`, `return None`, `return []`, or bare logging, without addressing why the exception occurs.
- **INSTANCE-ONLY FIX**: new `if` guards that skip/short-circuit on specific inputs (e.g., `if name == "X": return`). Ask what class of inputs is being masked.
- **UNJUSTIFIED TUNING**: magic number tweaks (numeric literal changes) with no test and no explanation of why the old value was wrong.
- **HARD-CODED PATCH**: hard-coded special cases in dicts/maps to work around bad data.
- **ADMITTED BAND-AID**: comments containing `hack`, `workaround`, `temporary`, `TODO: fix`, `FIXME`.
- **FIX IN WRONG LAYER**: output sanitization/post-processing that implies an upstream bug. Fix belongs upstream.
- **DEFENSIVE MASK**: `var = None` or default-value-on-exception patterns that hide broken state downstream.

A real fix also includes a test that would have failed before the fix. Absence: **NO REGRESSION TEST**.

### 4. Engineering principle check (applies CLAUDE.md rules to the diff)

Flag:

- Dead code: commented-out blocks, unused imports, unused functions, `# removed` markers.
- Speculative abstractions: new helpers/classes used once, parameters/flags not required by the task.
- Unrelated refactors: "while I was in here" cleanup.
- Comments explaining WHAT the code does (redundant with clear naming) vs WHY (non-obvious constraints). The former are noise.
- Backward-compatibility shims or feature flags not asked for.
- Renamed-but-preserved symbols (`_var`, `# kept for compat`) in purely internal code — delete, don't preserve.

### 5. Test discipline

- Bug-fix commits without a test that would have failed before: **NO REGRESSION TEST**.
- New feature files with no corresponding `tests/` file: **UNTESTED FEATURE**.
- Tests that just re-assert the implementation does what it does (tautological): **USELESS TEST**.
- Happy-path-only coverage when the change has obvious error paths: **HAPPY-PATH ONLY**.

### Output format

Be concrete. Cite `file:line`. No generic findings.

## Token Discipline

- Never re-read a file already read this session unless it was modified since.
- Prefer anatomy.md descriptions over full file reads when possible.
- Prefer targeted Grep over full file reads when searching for specific code.
- If appending to a file, do not read the entire file first.

## Design QC

When the user asks you to check, evaluate, or improve the design/UI of their app:

1. Run `openwolf designqc` via Bash to capture screenshots.
   - The command auto-detects a running dev server, or starts one from package.json if needed
   - Use `--url <url>` only if auto-detection fails
   - The command saves compressed JPEG screenshots to `.wolf/designqc-captures/`
   - Full pages are captured as sectioned viewport-height images (top, section2, ..., bottom)
2. Read the captured screenshot images from `.wolf/designqc-captures/` using the Read tool.
3. Evaluate the design against modern standards (Shadcn UI, Tailwind, clean React patterns):
   - Spacing and whitespace consistency
   - Typography hierarchy and readability
   - Color contrast and accessibility (WCAG)
   - Visual hierarchy and focal points
   - Component consistency
   - Whether the design looks "dull" or "white-coded" (generic, no personality)
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback with fix suggestions.
5. If the user approves, implement the fixes directly in their code.
6. After fixes, re-run `openwolf designqc` to capture new screenshots and verify improvement.

**Token awareness:** Each screenshot costs ~2500 tokens. The command compresses images (JPEG quality 70, max width 1200px) to minimize cost. For large apps, use `--routes / /specific-page` to limit captures.

## Reframe — UI Framework Selection

When the user asks to change, pick, migrate, or "reframe" their project's UI framework:

1. Read `.wolf/reframe-frameworks.md` for the full framework knowledge base.
2. Ask the user the decision questions from the file (current stack, priority, Tailwind usage, theme preference, app type). Stop early once the choice narrows to 1-2 options.
3. Present a recommendation with reasoning based on the comparison matrix.
4. Once the user confirms, use the selected framework's prompt from the file — **adapted to the actual project** using `.wolf/anatomy.md` for real file paths, routes, and components.
5. Execute the migration: install dependencies, update config, refactor components.
6. After migration, run `openwolf designqc` to verify the new look.

**Do NOT read the entire reframe-frameworks.md into context upfront.** Read the decision questions and comparison matrix first (~50 lines). Only read the specific framework's prompt section after the user chooses.

## Session End

Before ending or when asked to wrap up:

1. **Update `.wolf/STATUS.md`** — move concluded work to ✅, write next quest in 🚀, bump date. This is the most important step for next session efficiency.
2. Write a session summary to `.wolf/memory.md`.
3. Review the session: did you learn anything? Did the user correct you? Did you fix a bug? If yes, update `.wolf/cerebrum.md` and/or `.wolf/buglog.json`.
