# This is a bootstrap helper: most Vamp plugin packs don't ship with
# stable download URLs, so a fully automated fetch isn't possible. The
# script verifies each expected .dylib is present and prints clear
# instructions for any that are missing. Run once per supported arch.
#
# Usage: ./packaging/scripts/fetch-vamp-plugins.sh <aarch64|x86_64>

# Expected plugin packs. `.dylib` suffix is the canonical macOS Vamp
# plugin extension. Names match what Python code requests via
# `vamp.load_plugin()` (see src/analyzer/algorithms/vamp_*.py).
#
# Format per entry: "<filename>|<source-url>"
# (Plain array instead of associative array so this runs on macOS's
# stock bash 3.2 — `declare -A` needs bash 4+.)
