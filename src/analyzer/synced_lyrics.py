"""Synced-lyrics lookup: fetch, parse, and derive chorus text for boundary refinement.

Uses ``syncedlyrics`` (a token-free, multi-provider LRC aggregator) to feed
``src.story.boundary_refinement``'s Fix 1 (merge short post_chorus tails)
and Fix 2 (relabel/split a bridge whose sung content opens with the chorus
first-line hook). Unlike the retired Genius integration, LRC carries no
``[Chorus]``/``[Verse]`` structural headers — this module does not produce
section labels or boundaries, only word timing and a best-guess chorus text
block derived from line repetition.
