"""CLI entry point for xlight-analyze.

This package splits the CLI into submodules by command group.  The ``cli``
Click group is defined here and each submodule registers its commands by
importing this group.  All submodules are imported at the bottom of this
file so that commands are registered before ``cli`` is invoked.

``src.cli:cli`` remains the entry-point callable.
