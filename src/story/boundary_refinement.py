"""Lyric-anchored boundary refinement.

Four small, targeted refinements applied after the existing section-boundary
derivation in the story builder. Consumes WhisperX forced-alignment word marks
(already produced for vocal sections) and a free-transcription word stream
(``src.analyzer.free_transcription.transcribe_free``) for ground-truth
``is anyone audibly singing here`` evidence.

OpenSpec change: ``lyric-anchored-boundary-refinement``.

Empirical record (Fix 1-3 only): 16-song corpus run produced 8 fires, 0
false positives — Cher (Fix 1 + Fix 2 full + Fix 3), Crazy Train (Fix 2
split + Fix 3), Ghostbusters (Fix 2 full), Hoist the Colours (Fix 3), Down
with the Sickness (Fix 3); 11 others zero fires. Fix 4 (``split_on_
repeated_hook``, added 2026-08-05) hasn't been run against this corpus yet
— it only *splits* on repeated-hook evidence, never relabels role, so a
wrong fire is a spurious boundary rather than a wrong role, but treat it as
less battle-tested than Fix 1-3 until it has its own corpus record.

Section dict shape (per ``src/story/builder.py``)
-------------------------------------------------
- ``role``: one of the values in ``VALID_ROLES`` (this module treats
  the role as the "kind" referenced by the spec)
- ``start``, ``end``: floats in seconds
- ``agreement_score``: int (0..N)
- ``boundary_refinements``: list[str] — added by ``refine_section_boundaries``,
  always present after this module has run (empty list when no refinement
  fires).

    """Split a section wherever the chorus hook line repeats inside it.

    Some songs (through-composed pop/holiday songs without a clean
    verse/chorus alternation — e.g. "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the
    Year", user-reported 2026-08-05: "one big long verse in the middle")
    repeat the same hook line multiple times within what audio-only
    structure detection (segmentino/qm_segmenter) keeps as a single long
    section, because there's no strong timbral/spectral change between
    repeats for a pure-audio detector to key off. Lyric repetition is
    stronger evidence of a real structural boundary than the absence of an
    audio change is evidence there ISN'T one.

    Deliberately only splits — it does not relabel role to "chorus" (that's
    Fix 2's narrower, corpus-validated bridge-specific job; this fires on
    any non-chorus, non-instrumental role and a wrong role guess would be
    worse than no guess). Each resulting piece keeps the original role.
    Skips sections already labelled "chorus" (nothing to split against
    itself) and instrumental sections. Only fires on *interior* repeats —
    an occurrence within ``min_piece_ms`` of the section start isn't split
    off (there'd be nothing meaningful before it), and every resulting
    piece must be at least ``min_piece_ms`` long, so a spurious rapid
    double-match can't produce a sliver section.
