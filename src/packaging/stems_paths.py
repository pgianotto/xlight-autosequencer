"""Resolve the stem cache root with a writable-fallback.

In dev and CLI use we keep the current convention: stems live under
`<source_parent>/<source_stem>/stems/` (or `<source_parent>/stems/` when
parent directory name already matches the source stem). In packaged mode,
users drop files from macOS locations where the packaged app may not have
write permission (Music, Desktop, iCloud Drive). When that happens we fall
back to `~/Library/Application Support/XLight/stems/<source_stem>/stems/`
so the cache is still usable and discoverable.

Layout decisions live in `src.analyzer.stems.StemCache.__init__` — this
helper only decides whether to place the cache source-adjacent or in the
Application Support fallback.
