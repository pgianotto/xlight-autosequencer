    Rules:
    - Each section's mood_tier drives the primary theme query
    - When essentia scale is available, low-energy sections in minor-key
      songs prefer "dark" themes over "ethereal"
    - Adjacent sections get different themes (rotate through candidates)
    - Repeated section types (e.g. Chorus 1, Chorus 2) get the same theme
      but with different variation_seed values
    - Fallback broadening: genre -> "any", then occasion -> "general"

    ``base_variation_seed`` shifts every section's variation seed by a
    constant offset (default 0 preserves the historical
    ``variation_seed=section_index`` behaviour) and rotates the starting
    position within each mood's candidate pool, so two songs with the
    same section-mood sequence get different theme lineups. Generation
    derives it from the audio hash (``generator_runner._derive_seed``);
    the microscope tool pins it for deterministic measurement runs.
